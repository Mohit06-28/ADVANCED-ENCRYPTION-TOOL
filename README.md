# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS
**ADVANCED ENCRYPTION TOOL :** 
 ***Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) Overview***
AES-256 is a symmetric encryption algorithm standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is widely used for secure data encryption due to its robustness and efficiency.
Key :-
Symmetric Key Encryption: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
Block Cipher: Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 128 bits).
Key Size: AES-256 uses a 256-bit key, making it highly secure against brute-force attacks.
Modes of Operation: Common modes include ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and GCM, each providing different security properties.

**Building the Tool :-**
***1. Requirements Analysis***
Needs: Determine the target audience and their needs, such as file encryption, secure storage, and ease of use.
Features: Define key features like encryption, decryption, key management, and user interface.
***2. Algorithm Selection***
AES-256: Choose AES-256 for its balance between security and performance.
Libraries: Select cryptographic libraries like pycryptodome for Python or javax.crypto for Java.
***3. Encryption and Decryption Implementation***
Key Generation: Generate strong, random keys using a secure random number generator.
Encryption: Implement the AES-256 algorithm to encrypt data, ensuring confidentiality.
Decryption: Implement the corresponding decryption process to retrieve original data.
***4. Interface Design***
Command Line Interface (CLI): For initial simplicity and testing.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Use frameworks like Tkinter (Python) or JavaFX (Java) to create a user-friendly interface.
***5. Security Considerations***
Key Management: Securely store and manage encryption keys.
Data Integrity: Ensure data has not been tampered with using techniques like hash functions and message authentication codes (MACs).
Usability: Balance security and ease of use to encourage adoption by users.
***6. Testing and Validation***
Test Cases: Develop comprehensive test cases to validate functionality and security.
Security Audits: Conduct security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
***7. Documentation***
 Manual: Provide clear instructions for users on how to use the tool.
Developer Documentation: Document the code, architecture, and design decisions for future maintenance.
